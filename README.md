# Introduction

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="./images/Logo.png">

Multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage where many problems remain unexplored. As a part of [Arena](https://sites.google.com/view/arena-unity/) project, this repository is to provide a building toolkit for researchers to easily invent and build novel multi-agent problems.
More resources can be found in [Arena Home](https://sites.google.com/view/arena-unity/).
If you use this repository to conduct research, we kindly ask that you [cite the paper](#citation) as a reference.

## Status: Pre-release

We are currently open to any suggestions or pull requests from the community to make Arena a better platform.
To contribute to the project, [contact us via Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/arena-ml/shared_invite/enQtNjc1NDE1MTY0MjU3LWMxMjZiMTYyNTE3OWIzM2QxZjU5YmI1NTM2YzYzZDZlNjY0NzllMDFlMjA3MGZiN2QxODA1NTJhZDkzOTI3Nzg).
If you have a game in mind you want to study, you are wellcome to [contact us via Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/arena-ml/shared_invite/enQtNjc1NDE1MTY0MjU3LWMxMjZiMTYyNTE3OWIzM2QxZjU5YmI1NTM2YzYzZDZlNjY0NzllMDFlMjA3MGZiN2QxODA1NTJhZDkzOTI3Nzg) or open an issue.
We are happy to implement it for you, if it's helpful for the community.

## Acknowledgement

We give special thanks to the [Whiteson Research Lab](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) and [ML-Agents team](https://unity3d.com/machine-learning/), with which the discussion shaped the vision of the project a lot.
Also, we use some free packages from [Unity Assets Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) list in [the reference section](#references), the code of which is publically available in the Unity Assets Store.
We thank them for their generosity and contribution to the community.

We also use two packages that is not free (list in [the reference section](#references)), thus, the code of these two packages is not included in the code release.
But the compiled binary files are released in [Arena-Baselines](https://github.com/YuhangSong/Arena-Baselines).
